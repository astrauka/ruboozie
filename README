Ruboozie
========
A ruby library for Apache Oozie.

Author

This was extracted from https://github.com/dguttman/oozie-web-ui
Full credit goes to @dguttman for most of the initial code in this project.


Features
=======
- tested against oozie 2.x from CDH3u3
- list jobs
- query a specific job
- submit a job [workflow/coordinator]
- cancel, start, and otherwise modify a job
- Real models for the classes, not just hashes.
- hopefully sensible error messages [still needs work]

Meh
======
- currently other params for job listing is not supported
- some error messages don't come through properly in the response headers, so in that case it uses the response body [html], not ideal but better than nothing.

Example
=======

OozieApi.setup("http://localhost:11000/oozie")

properties =  {'user.name' => 'matthew', 
              'oozie.wf.application.path' => 'hdfs:///workflows/hello_world/workflow.xml'}

job = OozieApi.submit_job(properties, :action => :start)

puts job.id
puts job.status

while !job.finished?
  job = job.reload #creates a new object
  sleep(1)
end

puts job.failed? ? "FAILED" : "COMPLETED"
